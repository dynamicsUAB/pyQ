# Database

All the jobs and their related information will be stored in a YAML file, which will work as the database file. 
Each entrance will be stored under the key 'jobid' and it will be appended to the database file.

## Example

```yaml
jobid :
  - jobname : 
  - username : 
  - sent_time : 
  - cores :
  - gpus :
  - timelimit :
  - copy : 
```
